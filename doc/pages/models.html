    <p>
        Pages may contain information that are changeable and as such, must be updated on 
        the user's device. To this end, data are being received from and sent to the server.
        These data are referred to as models.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every model must have a unique id which differentiates it from others e.g. users. 
        This is required to keep updating working fluently without interfering with other
        models that are not changed.
    </p>


    <p class="heading">
        Create a model with html tags:
    </p>
    <div this-block-code><div this-id="users" this-type="model">...</div></div>
    <p>Or with its custom tag:</p>
    <div this-block-code><model this-id="user">...</model></div>
    <p>
        Models can be loaded from the server with attribute
        <a href="#" this-goto="attributes&this-url">
            this-url
        </a>. 
        <a href="#" this-goto="attributes" this-run="app._('a#models').trigger('click')">
            See all model attributes here
        </a>
    </p>

    <h2 class="heading"><a name="attributes">Model Attributes</a></h2>
    <p>
        Model attributes can be rendered by putting the key in double curly brackets, that
        is, {{KEY}}.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the object below:
    </p>
    <div this-block-code>
var user = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    gender: "Male",
    hobbies: [
        "eating",
        "sleeping"
    ],
    socials: {
        facebook: "http://facebook.com/john.doe",
        twitter: "http://twitter.com/john.doe"
    }
}
    </div>
    <p>
        to show the user's first name, we would do <span this-inline-code>{{firstName}}</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        To target hobbies, we would do <span this-inline-code>{{hobbies.0}}</span> and 
        <span this-inline-code>{{hobbies.1}}</span> which would render 'eating' and 
        'sleeping' respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        To target socials, we would do <span this-inline-code>{{socials.facebook}}</span> and
        <span this-inline-code>{{socials.twitter}}</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alternatively, we could loop over both <code>hobbies</code> and <code>socials</code> with
        tag attribute <a href="#" this-goto="attributes&this-each">this-each</a>
    </p>


    <h2 class="heading"><a name="filtering">Filtering</a></h2>
    <p>
        Model attributes can be filtered by appending the desired filters the the attributes name,
        all separated by pipes (|). e.g. {{firstName|trim|capitalize}}. The value of `firstName` is 
        passed to filters left-to-right, that is to trim first, then to capitalize.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below are the available filters
    </p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Filter</th>
                <th>Parameters</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody this-type="collection" this-id="filters" this-url="filters.json">
            <tr>
                <td>{{id}}</td>
                <td>{{params}}</td>
                <td>{{description}}</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2 class="heading"><a name="binding">Binding</a></h2>
    <p>
        Models can be bound to HTML elements, which would render the attributes as described above.
        To do this, give a link element, that is within the model element, attribute
        <a this-goto="attributes&this-bind">this-bind</a> with its value as the id of that target
        element:
        <span this-block-code><a href="#" this-bind="form#user">...</a></span>
        The above assumes that the element below exists:
    <div this-block-code><form this-id="user">...</form></div>
    or
    <div this-block-code><div this-type="form" this-id="user">...</div></div>
</p>
<p>
    If the target contains form elements, they will be filled with the right variables. 
    <a this-goto="forms">See more about form elements here</a>.
</p>


<h2 class="heading"><a name="object">CRUD</a></h2>
<p>
    Models may need to be operated upon CRUD-ly (Create, Read, Update, Delete). To do this, link tags
    would need be provided and specified what the intent is. Note that all link tags except for Create
    must be within the model element, that is, the element with
</p>
<h3>Create</h3>
<div this-block-code><a this-goto="form#user" this-create="/path/to/create">...</a></div>
<p>
    The `this-create` attributes indicates that
